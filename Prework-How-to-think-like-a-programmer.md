### Steps to think like a Programmer when encountering a new Problem:  
1. Understand  
2. Plan  
3. Divide  
4. Stuck?  
5. Practice Practice Practice  

#### 1. Understand  
- You must first understand the problem at hand, like really understand. Speak your understanding into existence, either outloud or to someone. Being able to talk about what the problem is asking in plain english, lets you know that you understand the problem ahead.  

#### 2. Plan  
- Great programmers do not just straight to solutions or coding. They plan there solution, they develop steps or an "algorithm' that will guide them from input to output of the problem. This can be in the form of comments or pseudo-code or even hand written notes.  

#### 3. Divide  
- Divide your problem into the smallest pieces possible. Then start solving them one little problem at a time. Start with what you know, then move on to the ones you might need to do research on. After you have solved all the smaller problems to the big problem, you should be able to connect them all up to have one solution.  

#### 4. Stuck?  
- Best programmers/problem solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.  
- Three steps to get over a obstacle:  
    - Debug: Go to the source of where the it all went wrong, and try and trace your code up to the point it fails. 
    - Reassess: Take a step back, take a 5 min break, and attempt to view this problem from a different perspective. This can lead to need paths and solutions  
    - Research: Great programmers reference documentation daily. Google, stack overflow, whatever it may be, there are resources out there to help solve the problem.
