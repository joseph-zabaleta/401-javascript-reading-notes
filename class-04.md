## Additional Resources  

### Cloud Databases  
There are a few alternatives to running Mongo locally for your web servers  
- [Mlab]() :  remotely hosted mongoDB systems. Easily setup a free database (or pay for more horsepower). Works great with Heroku  
- [Atlas]() : Cloud based, highly scalable Mongo DB  
- [DynamoDB]() : AWS NoSQL Database. Very highly scalable. Also provides a ‘mongoose’-like ORM called ‘dynamoose’  
- [CosmosDB]() : The Microsoft Azure equivalent for Atlas and Dynamo
