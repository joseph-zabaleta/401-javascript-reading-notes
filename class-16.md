[Table of Contents](README.md)  

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

#### 1. Why is access control important?
- This is pretty simple, on a high level, you not want your average users have admin abilities 

#### 2. Describe an application that would need access control.
- API Servers, routes, you would want different roles for users so thoses with more privileges can do more things.

#### 3. What is a role used for?
- Defining abilities for the a given users. 

#### 4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- When you have new access or want to add on new features. You can just add on new roles to a specific user when that user needs them, and take off roles if need be.

## Vocabulary Terms  

- `Authorization` :  
    - def: Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.
        - Resource: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization)  
- `Role Based Access Control` :  
    - def: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise.

- `Capabilities` : 
    - def: Users privileges, permissions. Capability-based security is a concept in the design of secure computing systems, one of the existing security models. A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights.
