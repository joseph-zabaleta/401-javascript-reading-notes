# Class-36 Reading: Application State with Redux

[Table of Contents](README.md)  

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

#### 1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
- Saving anything in local storage is easily accessible with JavaScript. While using cookies, they are not, making it safe XSS attacks involving your access token.  

#### 2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
- Third party token services are authenticators. They are a place to hold and manage all your cookies, and makes them easier to use.

#### 3.How do pixel tags work? 
- Once a browser reads a pixel tag, it will collect information from the user, URL, and the page.
