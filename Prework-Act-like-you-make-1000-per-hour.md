This article talks about the truth to people and there time management. People value their time far less than what it's actually worth. If people distribute there time more efficiently they can reach the goals that truly matter to them.  
  
Consider these questions below:  
- What if you placed a high value on your time?  
    - Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
- How would that change you? Your life? Your family? Your future?  
- What would your life look like?  
- What people would you stop putting up with?  
- What problems would you stop wasting time on?  
- What things would you stop -- and start -- doing?  

Your results would change your mind and outlook on life. This would lead to a more productive, focused, and effective life choices.  

I would give you this simple list of things to do:  
- Write down your goals  
- Next write down the things you did today or this week.  
    - Went for a walk, played games, read a book, watched netflix, etc.  
- Then ask your self what tasks did I accomplish today that were worth $1000/hr or maybe just ask yourself are your tasks helping you reach your goals, or are they delaying you.  
- How many tasks were a true waste of time?  

This would be a start to self identifying some time management problems and areas to improve. Stay focused not busy!
