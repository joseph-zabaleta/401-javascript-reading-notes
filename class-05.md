# Class-05 Linked Lists
[Table of Contents](README.md)  

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

List of one-line summary items worth noting:  
- Linked List is a linear data structure and not in contigous memory locations.  
- Last node always points to null  
- Arrays and linked lists are different, as arrays are fixed in size while linked list is dynamic.  
- Linked List costs less to insert or delete item.  
- `Next`: Property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.  
- An "item" in a linked list is called a `node`.  
- The first node in a linked list is called the `head`  
- The last node in a linked list is called the `tail`    
- `Current` Node: This is the most helpful. `Current` Node will tell us exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.  
- `while()`: Best way to approach a traversal through a linked list.  
- Adding or removing a node from a linked list is a fast operations.(Big O in mind)  
- Flexible in size: Memory allocation does not require elements to be blocked together. Linked Lists can be created and nodes can be added as long as there is space on the machine.
