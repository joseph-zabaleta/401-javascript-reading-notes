[Table of Contents](README.md)  

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

### HTTP
- ![HTTP Doc](./assets/http.png)  

HTTP is often associated with serving `.html` files but also used to transfer images, videos, `.json`, `.xml`, binary executables, and more.

### HTTP Requests  
- A HTTP/1.1 request is formatted in text and transferred using TCP  
- The first line of the request contains `METHOD`, `URL`, and `HTTP VERSION`.

- Example Request: 
    - ![exampleRequest](./assets/exampleRequest.png)


### HTTP Response  
- A HTTP/1.1 response is also formatted in text and transferred using TCP.  
- The first line of the response contains the `HTTP VERSION`, `STATUS CODE`, and `STATUS MESSAGE`.  

- Example Response:

### REST

- Means... by which we can reference, manipulate, and trasfer state. 
- A `RESTful Endpoint` is a URL that identifies the resource. When addressed with a proper method, you are able to effect state. In normal terms, this means "Performing CRUD operations over HTTP".  

- RESTful Endpoint: `http://api.server.com/api/v1/people`  
    - `http://`: Protocol/Scheme  
    - `api.server.com`: Domain or Server 
    - `/api/v1`: API Endpoint  
    - `/people`: The resource (This identifies a collection: all people)  
    - `people/12345`: A more specific resource: The person with id 12345.  

- REST / CRUD Connections

- RESTful endpoints generally deliver data in JSON format.  

### REST Documentation (Swagger)  
- Open API formally known as Swagger, is a documentation service. It helps document all the routes / paths / HTTP requests that can be made to an API.
